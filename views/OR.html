   <h1>CRITICAL PATH METHOD EXAMPLE</h1>
   <p1>Critical Path Method, abbreviated as CPM, is a network technique that is concerned with obtaining the trade-off, between cost and completion        date for large projects. In any project consisting of several activities each activity can be completed in a normal duration with normal        cost. If we employ more persons or skilled people or given overtime to the workers, the activity could be completed in a reduced duration        known as crash duration. But this involves an increased cost in the form of additional resources. With CPM the amount needed to complete the        various activities is assumed to be known with certainity. So, the direct costs for the activities increase and hence the cost of the project        also increases. By reducing the activity duartion of some or all possible activities, the project completion time is decreased or the project        is completed ahead of the schedule. This will naturally reduce the overhead cost for the entire project. On one hand the direct expenses        increase, if we shorten the activity duration, but, the indirect expenses for the project are reduced. We have to strike a balance or an        optimum time schedule, or a least cost schedule is to be obtained. This is the purpose of the Critical Path Method.
